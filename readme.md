### XFCE4 Desktop Environment installer script for Proot-distro Distros (Debian based Linux).

**Reminder!**<br/>
This script was made for any Debian Based Distros that runs inside Proot, it won't work outside Proot (unless if you're brave enough to broke your Termux), but don't worry, the script won't run if you accidentally execute it outside Proot Container.

## To sum it all....
A simple yet long (and also interactive) Desktop Environment installer for any Debian based Linux Distributions (or any distribution as long as it has APT).

# Depedencies

1. sudo
2. chafa
3. procps
4. apt-utils
5. neofetch

Can be satisfied with running `installdeps.sh`.<br/>
Isn't that simple? Of course, **I do care about those beginners.**
# Oh, yas...the features...
1. Managing your DE (fixing, purging, installing).
2. Creates `vnc-start` script for those whom lazy (this was optional only if you're not into XSDL).
3. Checks your hardware properties before installations.
4. Creates `xstartup` script (this was optional tho, only if you're not into XSDL).
5. Disabling password for `sudo`, as well as pam.d annoying password questionary.
# How to basic.
Clone this repo, then :
```
cd de-installer
chmod u+x installer.sh installdeps.sh
```
Then... Make it happen..
# Future plannings.
1. Multimedia installer improvements.
2. Code optimisations.
3. More perks.
4. Some cute anime characters that dances inside this script.
5. Back to number two.

## Extras

→ This script was entirely made in [Samsung Galaxy A03](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a03-11244.php).<br/>
→ Call me a n00b because I'm using [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) as my main text editor, well, you can't blame on me since nano was easy to use.<br/>
→ [Proot-Distro](https://github.com/termux/proot-distro), a great Termux toolset for installing latest Linux Distros, unlike [Andronix](https://github.com/AndronixApp/AndronixOrigin), they're all outdated and mostly LTS.<br/>
→ Of course, our main star, it's [Proot](https://github.com/termux/proot)!<br/>
→ *Something's hiding inside this script, can you find it?*
